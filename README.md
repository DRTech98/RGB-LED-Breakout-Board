# RGB-LED-Breakout-Board
A breakout board created to test code for projects that involve RGB LEDs

A simple breakout board that incorporates an electrolytic capacior and resisor for the signal line for maximum proection and voltage stability of the RGB led, can be used when prototyping circuits on bread boards. 

Zip of project includes schematic and layout created in Ki CAD 6.
